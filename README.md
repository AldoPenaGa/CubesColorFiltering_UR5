## Overview
  
This project consists of a color sorting system that uses the UR5 model robot from Universal Robots and MATLAB image processing software in order to achieve its goal. The system was able to detect the location and color of cubes on a workbench from a picture, allowing the robot to sort the objects into bins based on their color. Also, some filters that introduced noise were added to make the program more powerful and robust.

### Key Components

- UR5 Robot Arm: The UR5, a versatile industrial robot, plays a crucial role in physically handling and sorting objects. It can pick up items from a workbench and place them into designated bins

- MATLAB Image Processing: We’ve developed a robust image processing pipeline using MATLAB. It identifies the location of objects on the workbench and determines their colors. The processed data is then used to guide the robot’s actions.

### Installation and Setup

Before diving into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- UR5 robot (or a compatible robotic arm)
- MATLAB installed (version X.X or higher)
- Webcam or camera for image capture


1. Install MATLAB (R2023a or newer version). https://la.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html

2. Install the Image Processing Toolbox in MATLAB. https://la.mathworks.com/products/image.html

3. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/AldoPenaGa/UR5_CubesColorFiltering_MATLAB

```
